(** Rate limiter built on top of a token bucket. Provides async and sync
    submission of callbacks that are rate-limited. Uses a worker thread
    to process queued callbacks when tokens become available. *)

type t

val create : burst_size:float -> fill_rate:float -> t
(** [create ~burst_size ~fill_rate] creates a new rate limiter with the given
    token bucket parameters. Raises [Failure] if the parameters are invalid
    (e.g. non-positive fill rate).
    @param burst_size Maximum number of tokens in the bucket
    @param fill_rate Number of tokens added per second *)

val delete : t -> unit
(** [delete t] signals the worker thread to terminate and waits for it to
    finish processing any remaining queued callbacks. *)

val submit_async : t -> callback:(unit -> unit) -> float -> unit
(** [submit_async t ~callback amount] submits a callback under rate limiting.
    If tokens are immediately available and no callbacks are queued, the
    callback runs synchronously on the calling thread. Otherwise it is
    enqueued and will be executed by a worker thread when tokens become
    available. Returns immediately. *)

val submit_sync : t -> callback:(unit -> 'a) -> float -> 'a
(** [submit_sync t ~callback amount] submits a callback under rate limiting
    and blocks until it completes, returning the callback's result. If tokens
    are immediately available and no callbacks are queued, the callback runs
    directly. Otherwise, the caller blocks until the worker thread signals
    that tokens are available. *)
